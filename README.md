veiligstallen_voorbeeld
=======================

Showcase project using VeiligStallen open source data

This is still work-in-progress. The current version may not compile or run, it is only meant to show some of my preferred coding styles like the use of object graphs, dependency injection, messaging bus, Android's content provider, etc. Some of this code has been copied from pieces of previous work while others were custom made for this project.

It's unlikely I'll find the time to finish this project, but the idea is rather simple. Load data from the veiligstallen dataset and display it using a mapsview, a listview, a detail view and for tablets a dual plane that combines detail and list view.
