=======================

Hobby project using VeiligStallen open source data

This is still work-in-progress. The primary goal of this project is to find a suitable method of decoupling Android's activity lifecycle from a proper MVVM architecture implementation. If this effort succeeds, it would produce a new method for Android app development that bypasses the complexity that every app developer faces from how Activity / Fragment lifecycle and configuration changes work.

This project simply takes data from VeiligStallen.nl and aims to show it in a map view with search and navigation capabilities. The available data offers a lot of potential for more features, which may get added in the future.
